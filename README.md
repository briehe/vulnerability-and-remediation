# vulnerability-and-remediation
I created a virtual machine environment using Oracle VirtualBox for the purpose of creating an intentionally insecure and vulnerable client and installed outdated software, such as web browsers and operating systems, to simulate the process of vulnerability assessment and remediation.

I used Nessus to perform a comprehensive scan of the network and generate a detailed report of the findings, followed by an analysis of the report to prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact. I then implemented remediation strategies to address the vulnerabilities and enhance the security posture of the client, finally ending with a verification the effectiveness of the remediation by running another scan and comparing the results.

This repo contains several screenshots from Nessus during the various stages of the project:
1. Basic Windows 10 setup with no additional software added, scanned using a standard uncredentialed vulnerabity scan.
2. Same as above, but this time scanned with credentials in place, revealing more vulnerabilities.
3. Credentialed scan results after installing a distribution of Firefox from 2016 alongside not having run any Windows Updates, showing a large amount of vulnerabilities to the machine.
4. Final credentialed scan after having applied recommended remediations to the system, greatly lowering the machine's attack surface.
